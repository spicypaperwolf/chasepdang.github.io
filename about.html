						<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Lisa (Laney) Patrona, Dip. CBST, CPDT-KA, ACDBC, AABP-CDT President @Trainers Academy, LLC</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">Lisa recognized her affinity for all animals, but especially dogs, as a very young girl. She strongly believed even then, that dogs were misunderstood by their humans, and that many ended up losing their homes because of behavior problems.  After volunteering at an animal shelter, the very sad and often hopeless environment led her to decide that helping dogs stay in their homes and out of shelters by teaching humans about dog behavior and training, would become her life’s work. 

						In October of 2005, Lisa became the owner and President of Trainers Academy, LLC - 6 years after joining Trainers Obedience Centers’ staff. During her career she has worn many hats, including General Manager, Director of Behavioral Sciences, Class Instructor and Behavioral Consultant.

						Lisa graduated from the Companion Animal Sciences Institute in 2006 with honors, and holds a Diploma of Canine Behavior Science and Technology (formerly known as Diploma of Dog Training and Behavior Consulting). University level studies included developmental psychology, learning theory, training processes, canine social behavior, behavior modification, and professional ethics. 

						James O’Heare, CABC, President of Companion Animal Sciences Institute said this about Lisa. “Lisa completed her studies passing with Distinction, the highest level of recognition we offer for exceptionally excellent work. Lisa’s work demonstrates that she is highly knowledgeable in all areas of dog behavior, training and behavior consulting. The course work she completed was advanced, in-depth, and at the university level, requiring both academic and hands-on demonstration of her knowledge and skills. Lisa has also been an extremely helpful presence in class, participating in discussions and helping less knowledgeable students understand the topics under review. She has been so helpful in fact that we have asked Lisa to remain in class with us after graduation in order to contribute to future discussions for the benefit of our students.” 

						She earned the title of Certified Professional Dog Trainer - Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA), through the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers in 2002, joining the ranks of less than 500 others to become one of the first in history to earn the certification in the United States and Canada. 

						Lisa is a Certified Member of the Association of Animal Behavior Professionals (AABP), an Associate Certified Dog Behavior Consultant with the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC), a Professional Member of the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT), a Platinum Member of the InternationalAssociation of Force Free Pet Professionals (IAFPP), a Full Member of the Pet Professional Guild, and a member of Truly Dog Friendly.

						She writes the curriculum for Trainers' educational programs, as well as training articles that have been published on national websites. Her work was also published in the book The Association of Professional Dog Trainers Top Tips from Top Trainers, released in February 2010. She was featured in a front-page article in the Daily Tribune for her work with rescued dogs, and has also appeared in the Detroit News and Free Press, and on Detroit Public Television. In 2010 Lisa was nominated for, and honored with an award for Behavioral Therapy Excellence by the International Positive Dog Trainers Association. 

						In 2011, Lisa led her school to becoming the first facility in the world honored with personal acceptance by Victoria Stilwell to join her growing network of training professionals licensed by Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training, LLC.

						In 2012 she moved her business to a 6,500 square foot facility. Then, in 2016, Lisa and her husband, Tristan, purchased a commercial building and in January 2017, moved Trainers' once again to their forever home, with 12,000 square feet of space, on an acre of land. 

						Trainers Academy, LLC has been honored to win first place in the WDIV Click on Detroit Best Training category for the past 10 years. Lisa's business continues to grow along with what she calls "the most amazing staff Trainers' has ever had". 
						She shares life with her husband, Tristan, and their canine kids; Larry, Bradley and Maddie, and their feline kids, Laney, Jolie, and Dishie. 

						Waiting for Lisa and Tristan on other side of the Rainbow Bridge are their beloved dogs Jeff, Calvin, Benny, BuBu and Simon.

										<p>Dear Lisa, <br>
											We can't thank you enough!  For five years, whenever Peanut would get something he wasn't supposed to have, it was so frustrating trying to get it away from him, and sometimes he would bite me in the process.  After one session with you, we learned how to  give Peanut the "cue":  Peanut leave it!  And Peanut learned the proper response.  We have been practicing with Peanut for only two or three weeks and Peanut loves it as much as we do.  He can hardly wait for us to say, "Peanut leave it" and he does so immediately.  He's five years old and he learned new behavior on the spot.  Chuck, Carol and Peanut are much happier now. <br>
											Thanks again.</p>

										<p>Hi Lisa,<br>
											I just want to give a heartfelt thank you for your help with River. I know we still have a lot of work to do, but we're feeling much more hopeful than we were before starting the class. I was truly feeling like a complete failure as a doggy parent. But I'm feeling much more optimistic now that we're starting to form a plan for her. <br>
											The extra time you spent advising us on the phone, through email, and after class is VERY much appreciated. I can't thank you enough. Jessica has been very helpful and supportive as well. <br>
											We thought the class was great. The extra resources and homework provided were very helpful. Also, we really enjoyed the fun and supportive environment of the class.  We all had a lot of fun! River is still enjoying her new plushy toy - it's a miracle she hasn't torn it to shreds yet! <br>
											I'm sure we'll be in touch!</p>

										<p>Lisa, as always, goes above and beyond to help with behaviors and patiently explains the thoughts behind what is the best way to proceed. She takes time with each of her students (both human and canine) so that the lessons being taught are understood. Dixie has special problems and we were not made to feel like outsiders. Lisa took the time and precautions to make us feel included and not "problems". When you have a reactive dog, there is a stigma attached. Lisa never made us feel that way and she has taken time with Dixie outside of class to try and help her. All of that is very, very appreciated. If there were more classes to take, we would sign right up. We will be continuing with daycare.</p>

										<p>Thank you very much, Lisa! We were very nervous about taking Tank to training classes because we didn't want to be judged for having a dog with reactivity issues, but the staff did a fantastic job making us feel comfortable and relaxed, even when Tank would react to the environment. The weekly checklist helped keep us on track with training and the demonstrations that Lisa gave were very easy to follow. The staff was beyond friendly and welcoming, they truly cared about our situation. We both truly enjoyed the class and have learned so much. We also appreciate your insight and expertise on Tank's behavior management, you made us feel more than comfortable during class. I'm more confident in my training skills, as well as Tank's skills. We definitely will stay in touch!</p>

										<p>I love the theory behind it, and really enjoy that dogs become willing and excited to do certain ‘signals’ and excited to learn and focus on you. I also always appreciate Lisa’s attitude as people are learning and making mistakes. I’ve found many trainers over the years can be very condescending with the imperfections of people and their dogs and Lisa always meets them where they are at, offers sound solutions and encourages them. If you do that, people want to come back and learn. I spent some time in the 90’s involved in training and it was before the positive reinforcement concept was more popular, so it was some correction based training back then. Having experienced that, I know nothing compares to Positive Reinforcement/Clicker training in how dogs learn, nothing teaches more about understanding dog behavior and what motivates them, and I’m so glad Breeze and I have been having fun with this over his lifetime.</p>
