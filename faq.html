        					<p>When the dog is submissive and acting calm. He will be holding his head low, with his ears relaxed and slightly back. He might curl into a circle. Basically, he is slinking himself smaller, telling you he does not wish to be boss. You can give your dog all the love and affection you wish at this time.</p>
        					<p>Do not give your dog affection when he is excited, scared, nervous, anxious, or when he is showing signs of dominance—very perky and proud, looking and asking you for attention. A dog that is asking to be petted is demanding that you do something for him. A demand from a dog is an alpha behavior. Alpha behavior can also be seen when he carries himself proud with a stance that makes him look bigger. His ears will be perked. When dogs carry themselves like this they look beautiful, but in the dog world, this is a dog trying to puff himself out for the role of the leader. Dogs should not be petted or sweet-talked to at this time</p>
        					<p>When a dog is showing signs of dominance the dog should receive no affection until you are able to make him realize he is not the boss and he accepts it and begins to act submissive. The more submissive and stable-minded the dog gets, the more love you can give him. Dogs should not get any affection until the dominance is under control. Your affection will reinforce whatever mind frame (in human words, "mood") the dog is in.</p>

        					<p>No, absolutely not. Putting a dog that has OCD-like symptoms on medication is just covering up the problem rather than addressing the real issue. We need to look at the WHY. For the record, it is NOT genetic and certain dog breeds are NOT predisposed to it, however certain high-energy dogs are more likely to be lacking what they need as canines. We humans take these animals and live with them. A lot of us tend to treat them like humans, ignoring the fact that they are animals. We do not give them what they instinctually need and it literally drives them nuts. Dogs need clear leadership and direction. Their minds need to be challenged. They need daily consistent exercise where the dog is FOLLOWING the human, not the other way around, to satisfy their migration instinct. If you walk your dog every day, but fail to make your dog heel, you are not getting the most out of your walk. To keep a dog inside our nice fenced yards day after day is like putting a human in a padded cell and feeding them, but not giving them any type of challenge, and never letting them see the light of day. After a while, you guessed it, the human would begin to go cookoo. Before you put your dog on drugs try giving your dog what he is crying out for: exercise, leadership and direction. Take your dog for a long daily walk where he walks beside or behind you. Never in front, as the pack leader goes first. Set rules within your home and firmly stick to them. Be your dog’s strong leader so he can feel secure within himself. Dogs look for direction and authority. They crave it. They need to migrate DAILY. It's in their blood. In addition, if your dog is a working-type challenge her with a game so she can use what she was bred for.</p> 
        					<p>If your dog displays any behavior that could be considered an OCD symptom you are failing your dog as an owner. Treat your dog like a dog giving him what HE needs as an animal and you will start to see these OCD symptoms disappear.</p>

      				<div id="faq3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        				<div class="panel-body">
        					<p>A dog that snaps is a dog that is communicating to you that he is your leader and he simply wishes that you leave him alone while he eats (leader eats first...it's canine instinct). This is why it is so important to be 100% pack leader at all times, consistently. When someone is not or is wishy-washy about it, the dog becomes either unsure and tests you, or simply is convinced and becomes alpha. A dog communicates by growling, then snapping and biting. It happens because of the humans. It is the responsibility of the humans to understand this and be alpha 100% of the time or you will be tested by your dog. Dogs who are not 100% secure with their place are stressed dogs. Since we cannot allow a dog to be pack leader 100% of the time allowing the dog to make all the decisions, the dog becomes stressed and anxiety ridden. Sure, your dog may look happy because he is always excited, however excitement in a canine animal is NOT happy. It is just that, excited. Most dogs in America are not stable, balanced dogs because most people do not understand this. Dogs also have an instinct to migrate and how many people do you know who own dogs? Now how many dogs do you see going for walks? How many dogs that you DO see walking are walking in front of the humans? Pack leader goes first. Whatever happened to a dog heeling?? So dogs are pack leaders during their walks (in front), with what little walks they get in the first place, and then they get home and their owners expect them to behave. To not guard their food. They expect them to listen to them, expect them to not bolt out the door, not bark obsessively, and to not chew things up, all the while wondering why they are so hyper, etc... They are wishy-washy about who is leader. A dog that does not get a daily walk develops mental stress because he has this instinct to migrate. Packs of dogs get up in the morning and walk, they hunt to find food. Nope, sorry a big yard and/or big house does not cut it. It's just like a big cage to them. Most dogs are unstable, hence the reason we have so many dogs getting killed in pounds. It's the humans’ fault and oh so very sad. We take these animals and we have them live with us, yet we only take what we need as humans and do not give the dog what HE needs as a canine animal. Then we kill the dog for being unstable and get a new puppy. Nice cycle huh? We blame the pet overpopulation problem on breeders, however have you ever heard of supply and demand? If everyone were to keep their dog for life the demand for new pups would go down. Breeder does not sell pups, breeder does not breed as many...</p>

I have never had a dog this small before and have never encountered one with such a temper. She will growl if you go near her things, too.

        					<p>I am not able to tell you if you chose the right breed because I never met you, but I can take a good guess at why the dog is growling. It is very common for small dogs to be treated in a babyish manner with no leadership because they are so small. In the dog world there must be a leader. It's instinct for the dog to have a being that has a strong enough mind to keep their pack safe and secure. The strongest-minded being will run the home. The leader is either going to be the humans or it's going to be the dog.</p>	
        					<p>When your little dog growls at you she is communicating to you what SHE wants. She is trying to be your leader. She is telling YOU it is not time for her to be in her crate and she is telling you not to touch HER toys. Lower members of the pack do not own objects. All objects belong to the leader. One way dogs tell other beings that they own things is by growling and if that does not work, they eventually bite.</p>
        					<p>Every time she growls at you and you do not correct her or you back away she gets mentally stronger. The more you allow this the stronger she will become and eventually she will be biting. Not because she is a bad dog, but because she is being YOUR pack leader. You need to turn this around now or it will get worse and that is not fair to the dog that is only reacting on instinct.</p>
        					<p>I recommend you tune into the Dog Whisperer. There are DVDs for sale on Amazon.com. On the show, Cesar Millan demonstrates over and over again how to correct dogs who are acting like your little Chihuahua.</p>
        					<p>Here is an article to read that will help explain how dogs think and what instincts they have.</p>

        					<p>Believe it or not, most dogs don't want to be alpha. There are some that were born to be leaders but most will hand the position back to the owners in a heartbeat if they feel secure with the owners being strong-minded enough to handle it. Dogs can flip back and forth between taking the role over and giving it back, especially those who do not really want it. Those dogs that do not have to flip-flop because they are confident their humans can handle the role are much, much happier.</p>

        				<div class="panel-body">
        					<p>It is not recommended to leave food down for a dog for psychological reasons. Instinct tells a dog the pack leader decides when it is time to eat. Leaving the food down all of the time allows the dog to decide. If humans allow dogs to believe they are pack leader it causes various behavioral issues and sometimes it simply confuses the dog. A confused dog is not a happy dog. When a dog is not 100% clear about the order of the pack it does not feel secure. Therefore if you display leadership with some things and not with others, the dog will never be 100% sure.</p>
        					<p>Besides that, I personally do not know another way to feed two different dogs two different types of food unless you make a scheduled feeding time. Big dog eats in this corner, little dog eats in that corner. Your Havanese may decide not to eat the first couple of meals because he is not used to a schedule, however when a dog gets hungry enough, he will eat.</p>

        					<p>Being high-strung is never a breed "trait." It is by no means inherited. What a dog can inherit is a higher energy level, but any dog who does not receive the proper amount of exercise can become anxious and high-strung. When a dog is high-strung and extremely excitable it is a sure sign of a lack of mental and/or physical exercise. The whining is anxiety, from a lack of exercise and/or leadership. The more daily exercise you give your dog, where it not only makes her tired, but challenges her mind at the same time, the calmer your dog will be. Please keep in mind, exercise such as tossing a ball or a romp at the dog park is excited exercise and will keep your dog at a higher level of excitement, therefore, less calm. A pack walk is the perfect type of exercise to calm a dog. It not only physically tires a dog, but it is a mental challenge as well, because she needs to follow you, which takes concentration. It also reinforces the fact that you are pack leader, leading to respect and a better behaved dog.</p>

        					<p>I have a question about my aunt's 2-year-old Miniature Pinscher. We bought the dog when she was just a pup, and I have to say she has grown exceptionally fond of me. I believe the reason is that when we brought the dog in, she was terribly scared and nervous, and I was the one who mainly kept her on my lap, patting her and making her feel comfortable. I remember I could feel her shaking like crazy, but after a while she stopped and became very calm. From that moment on, she was totally in love with me; even if she only sees me every 1 or 2 weeks, she's always overjoyed when I get to my aunt's house. Even though she's a lively and adorable pet, she doesn't treat anyone else in the family with the impressive affection she has developed for me. The dog is generally well-behaved, but it's obvious that she doesn't see my aunt as a "leader" and doesn't really follow anything she says. She has never really been trained. We don't really have a big problem with that, the dog has a big house and yard, and it's OK if she does what she pleases, the only real issue is that she usually barks a lot and is very aggressive to strangers. Is it possible that the dog actually sees me as her "alpha," even if I see the dog once or twice a week? Even if she is a tad bit stubborn (due to lack of training), she gives a big importance to my reactions: if I scold her for something, she seems to get very sad and depressed, she stops being all lively and playful and goes into another room on her own, laying on the floor until I go back and "make peace." I absolutely don't abuse the dog in any way, and scolding her means only a big voice and a pat on her back. On the other hand when I play with her she's just incredibly happy, and truly doesn't look for that kind of love from anyone else in the family. So I am trying to understand if she sees me as some kind of alpha or if I'm just her "playmate." I'd like to try and give her some proper training, but not being with her often makes it a bit difficult.</p>

I realize it is inconvenient for the humans, however if we are going to live with dogs and expect them to behave as we wish then we need to understand how to communicate with them. Dogs develop behavior issues because we humans send all the wrong signals. A dog needs to be 100% sure the humans are able to take over the role as leader and keep their pack safe. By allowing the dog in front you are telling him that you wish him to be that leader.

        					<p>You have to wait until she gets tired of jumping. Only reward her with the leash when she calms down. The first time you do this it may take a long time. Be prepared to wait patiently, calmly and quietly with the leash in your hand. Dogs only have so much energy and she will eventually stop jumping just because she is tired. When she is calmly waiting reward her by putting on the leash. If she becomes hyper again when you start putting on the leash, wait longer. If she is calm when you snap the leash on and then becomes hyper right after, stand there and wait once again before proceeding. Do not reward her by beginning a walk while she is hyper. You must wait at each step until she learns that you only move forward when she is calm. After a while your dog will begin to realize that the leash only goes on when she is calm, the walk only happens when she is calm. The time you have to wait for her will become shorter and shorter and eventually she will be calm for you right from the beginning. In order to accomplish this you need to spend the time and be consistent. If you give in and put the leash on her when she is jumping and hyper she will never learn. If you put a leash on a hyper dog it is very hard to get her to walk correctly on a leash because her mind is set in hyper mode.</p>

After you get the actual walking down and the pup will walk while on a lead, which you can do by walking backwards with food in your hand as she tries to eat it, slowly begin practicing heeling on a lead. Teach her to not pass you (pack leader goes first); she should be following you. That will be the foundation of your relationship. Keep it positive and happy. Food always helps. For those slightly older energetic pups that insist on pulling from side to side and smelling everything, keep working at it, do not give up. The time you put into these younger years will be well-rewarded when the dog is older and larger. Be aware of her energy level and what she can handle at this time.

        					<p>As soon as you see your dog perk up as if he is going to bark the correction needs to be made. You need to try and catch him a second before he goes into a heightened state; timing is critical. You need to watch for signs of interest in whatever your dog is going to bark at and catch him right before he starts. Once a dog starts barking it is harder to make him stop because he is at a high level of excitement. The way you are feeling at the time has a lot to do with your success. If you are upset or anxious in any way your dog will feed from that emotion and it will intensify the dog's reaction to what he is about to bark at. You want to remain calm but very enthusiastic/serious. The correction can be a tug on the lead, a touch to the neck, a backwards bop with the side of your foot to the butt of the dog, a verbal correction such as "No," "Hey," "Aaatttt"—whatever works for that particular dog. You may also walk in front of your dog to block his view, lean forward and say, "No" and touch him in the neck if he continues to want to bark. Your intensity needs to match his without going too much over or you could intensify the dog’s reaction, but on the other hand if your intensity is less than his you will not be effective and the dog will not listen. Each and every time you hear your dog growl or bark you need to correct it. The intensity of the correction will vary from dog to dog, situation to situation. For example, a little Chihuahua may only need a two-finger touch to the neck, whereas a big Rottweiler may need a backwards boot to the butt with the side of your foot; where other dogs may only need a verbal command, others may need a combination.

        					<p>It's good to allow a dog to run free. However if that is all you do then the dog is not learning or practicing patience on a lead. I would not stop the free-roam walks, they are great, but for those times when you do need to leash your dog it is important that you teach good manners. I would start leashing the dog up at least a few times a week to practice lead walking, or even put the dog on a lead for only part of your walk in the woods just for practice. The dog needs to be trained that when you are free, you are free, but as soon as that lead snaps on you are to follow me heeling and not pull. I take my Bruno out to the woods and he runs and chases rabbits, etc...but as soon as I snap on the lead his entire demeanor changes and he knows it's time to follow.</p>
        					<p>You may want to bring the lead with you on your free walks. Put the lead on for a short time in the beginning and when the dog heels nicely for a bit make her sit and be calm, then take it off and allow her to go. Maybe even a few times until she gets the idea. I use my foot to backwards side-boot my dog in the butt below the tail if he starts to pull, but different things work for different dogs and owners.</p>
        					<p>Inside the house, practice making the dog sit calmly while you snap on the lead. At the gateway to the door practice going out the doorway first with the dog following. If you are on your way to an area where you can do a free-roam walk do not unsnap the dog's lead until she is heeling and walking nicely. Never unsnap her while she is pulling. You may have to take her out for some town walking for the socialization just so during those times she must be on a lead the dog is used to that type of environment. You need to convince her and condition her that when the lead is snapped on it means it's time to heel. It's going to take some time and a lot of work. But you can't give up or give in or the dog will learn to just keep pressing you in order to get her way.</p>

        					<p>There are a few reasons why a dog licks.</p>
        					<p>A dog's saliva contains a healing agent and dogs often lick another's wounds in an attempt to heel them.</p>
        					<p>Dogs will also lick as a way to show submission. A submissive dog will hold himself very low, slinking himself down to try to appear smaller. He will approach a human with his head lowered and his ears slightly back as if to say “you're my boss.”</p>
        					<p>Some dogs will lick another in a dominant manner. For example, mother dogs lick and groom their puppies and for the pups it is the mother displaying leadership. Mom says stay here and be groomed because she is alpha over them and she says so. Submissive licking and dominant licking have different body languages. A dominant dog will carry himself high and proud. He approaches things with an air of confidence. He may also be very persistent as to what he wants.</p>
        					<p>Sometimes dogs lick out of obsession. Dogs that lick others in an obsessive or dominant manner need to be corrected and the dog must be told not to lick.</p>

        					<p>Your dog is not necessarily "hating it" when you touch his food. Nor is he being "mean." He is communicating with you. What he is saying is, "This is MY food. Leave me alone while I eat it." Is this a problem? You bet it is. It's a big problem. It means your dog is alpha over you. There are different levels of dominance and even if your dog has never bitten, always keep in mind that growling or the bearing of a dog’s teeth eventually does lead to biting. It is time you reassess your human to dog communication skills and take the alpha position away from your dog before it escalates into a larger problem.</p>

        					<p>If you are having a bad day and are emotionally upset and your dog comes over and lies on top of you, be it your feet or lap, what does it mean? To the human it is very comforting. We feel that our dogs care and are trying to make us feel better. That's the human side of the equation.</p>
        					<p>What does it mean to the dog? Dogs do feel human emotion and since they are pack-oriented animals that need to know who the strongest being is so that being can run the pack, they see the weak as lower. It's instinct and there is nothing we can do to change that. A dog will pick up on a human's weakness and will claim that person as their subordinate by lying on top of them, be it their feet or their lap. Sometimes a dog will lick the person. In the dog world the leader is on top. The leader will often cover up the lower member by standing over them.</p>
        					<p>It is not realistic to say a human who owns a dog can never get upset. But it is a fact that when they do the dog will feel the human as weak. Different dogs will have different reactions. Some may become worried, stressed, anxious and/or upset because his leader is now weak and/or become empowered and try to "save the pack" by taking over. If you are emotionally upset and a dog comes over and lies on top of you, send the dog away back to his dog bed (or other area). Do not allow the dog to get on top of you. Try and take deep breaths and do your best to not be upset anymore. But to say you can never get upset is not going to happen, so you just deal with it when it happens and don’t allow the dog to be "in your face" or standing over you during that time.</p>

        					<p>It is not necessarily bad for a dog to be on top of a human if the HUMAN initiated it. For example, the human called the dog onto their lap. If it is the dog making the calls then it can be the dog being dominant. A dog that decides is a dog that is being the leader. Being on top is a dominant position in a dog's mind, but making the decisions is also a dominant position in a dog's mind. When humans are upset, dogs see this as a weakness. Keeping all of these facts in mind, you also need to know your dog and what frame of mind he is in, what frame of mind you are in and remain the leader at all times.</p>

        					<p>I suggest you tune into the Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan (if you have not done so already). He shows over and over again how to get two dogs to get along. He deals with a lot of powerful breeds. What you do not want to do is just toss the dogs together face-to-face at the first meeting in a shelter environment where the dog you are adopting is most likely lacking in exercise and human discipline. Before you even consider a second dog you need to first master the walk with your first dog.</p>
        					<p>On the day of adoption take your first dog for a really long walk or jog so her energy is drained before she meets this second dog.</p>
        					<p>As for the second dog, that dog needs to be taken for a walk as well to drain her energy. Then you would have a second person with you at the time the dogs meet and pack walk the dogs at the same time. Do not just stick them face to face. Just walk and walk for a long time. Both dogs need to be heeling because if one dog is allowed to be in front that dog will instinctually feel he is the leader of the bunch and will try and dominate the pack. Correct any negative reactions the dogs may have towards one another. While walking you can allow the dogs to smell one another's rear ends if the dogs are acting civil. By the end of your walk the dogs will regard themselves as one pack and if the humans were successful in convincing the dogs the humans are the leaders, the dogs will not feel the need to dominate or be leader. You will need to find a shelter that is willing to work with you on that method. Unfortunately too many shelters do not understand this concept and a lot of dogs are put down because of it.</p>
        					<p>I highly recommend you watch a good number of the Dog Whisperer shows before proceeding so you fully understand the basis behind this method.</p>

        					<p>I have not seen your dog around you, but going by what you say without observing I can tell you that it is not necessarily a bad thing. A dog that is submissive of another being will slink themselves smaller and put their ears back. A lot of people misread dogs when they see them puffed out proud with their ears erect thinking it means the dog is happy, when in reality it is the way a dog who believes he is alpha reacts. If your puppy puts her ears back and lowers her head that is a sign of respect. The fact that her tail is wagging and not tucked under leads me to believe this is the case. Your pup respects you and it is a good thing. Keep being the pack leader that you are. Lowering the head, ears back and curling into a circle are signs of submission. A dog wants to know who is boss so they can be secure. The pup is acting towards you the way she would act towards her canine mother. Make sure you stick with showing her the rules so she can keep looking at you as her leader. It makes for a happy dog.</p>

        					<p>Almost any dog can live in an apartment, IF...and this is a big IF...they get enough exercise and the right kind of exercise. If you plan on jogging your dog, and as long as you can make the dog heel on the jog so the dog is not worrying about being your leader, but rather relaxing as he is following you, you have a very wide range of dogs to choose from. Most dogs in the shelters are there because their owners... ONE did not provide proper leadership and TWO did not exercise them properly. A big backyard is not going to cut it. So those people who live in an apartment who actually walk their dogs (assuming they make them heel on the lead) are often better off than those who are simply only let out into the fenced backyard for exercise. Dog park exercise is excited exercise and it is not recommended as the only source of exercise a dog receives. It keeps the dog in an excited state of mind.</p>
        					<p>There are SO MANY great jogging companions in shelters. If you plan to jog every day then you would even qualify for a higher energy dog even though you are in an apartment. But if you plan on only jogging 2 or 3 times a week and plan to only walk the dog the remaining days, I would go with a medium-energy dog.</p>
        					<p>The thing to remember is, it is not necessarily the breed you are looking for but the energy level of that particular dog. There are pups born within every litter that are higher energy than other pups within the same litter, dogs within the same breed that are higher energy than others. That is why some folks will, for example, get a Lab as a pet and think it is wonderful and when that dog passes away they get another Lab and find the next one to be a nightmare. Their first Lab was low energy and low dominancy and the second one is high and high. Sure a Pointer is going to always be higher than a Clumber Spaniel, but they will still vary from dog to dog within the same breed.</p>
